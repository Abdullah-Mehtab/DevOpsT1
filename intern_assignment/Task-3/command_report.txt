Linux Command Activity Report
=============================

1. Display all lines containing error:
   Command: grep "error" logs.txt
   Explanation: The grep command searches for patterns in files. Here, it finds all lines containing the word "error".
   Flags: None used in this basic form.

2. Count how many times info appears:
   Command: grep -c "info" logs.txt
   Explanation: The grep command with the -c flag counts the number of lines that match the pattern.
   Flags: 
     -c: Count the number of matching lines instead of displaying them.

3. Print only the second word of each line:
   Command: awk '{print $2}' logs.txt
   Explanation: awk is a powerful text processing language. This command prints the second field (word) of each line.
   Flags: None. The pattern '{print $2}' tells awk to print the second field.

4. Count the number of lines:
   Command: wc -l logs.txt
   Explanation: The wc (word count) command counts lines, words, and characters. The -l flag counts only lines.
   Flags:
     -l: Print the line count.

5. Show all running processes containing the word nginx:
   Command: ps aux | grep nginx
   Explanation: 
     ps aux: Lists all running processes with detailed information
     |: Pipe symbol redirects output of ps to grep
     grep nginx: Filters processes containing "nginx"
   Flags for ps:
     a: Show processes for all users
     u: Display user-oriented format
     x: Include processes without a controlling terminal

6. Find how many processes are running for root:
   Command: ps aux | grep ^root | wc -l
   Explanation:
     ps aux: Lists all processes
     grep ^root: Filters processes where the owner starts with "root" (^ indicates start of line)
     wc -l: Counts the number of lines (processes)
   Flags:
     ^ in grep: Anchor to the beginning of the line

7. Display the IP address of your server/vm:
   Command: hostname -I
   Explanation: The hostname command with -I flag displays all IP addresses of the host.
   Flags:
     -I: Display all network addresses of the host

8. Show which ports are listening:
   Command: netstat -tuln | grep LISTEN
   Explanation:
     netstat: Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, etc.
     -t: TCP connections
     -u: UDP connections
     -l: Listening sockets
     -n: Show numerical addresses instead of trying to determine symbolic host names
     grep LISTEN: Filters for lines containing "LISTEN"
   Flags for netstat:
     -t: TCP
     -u: UDP
     -l: Show listening sockets
     -n: Don't resolve names

9. Ping google.com and redirect the output to a file:
   Command: ping -c 4 google.com > ping_result.txt
   Explanation: The ping command tests network connectivity. Output is redirected to a file.
   Flags:
     -c 4: Send 4 packets then stop
   Redirection:
     >: Redirects standard output to a file, overwriting if it exists

Additional Notes:
- Most commands can be combined with pipes (|) to create powerful processing pipelines
- grep uses regular expressions for pattern matching
- awk is a complete programming language for text processing
- Output redirection (> and >>) is a fundamental Linux concept
